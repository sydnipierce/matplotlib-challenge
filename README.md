# Overview

This repository houses an analysis of study data from Pymaceuticals on the impact of cancer drug interventions on mice. Specifically, it contains the following folders:

* Pymaceuticals
* Resources

## Pymaceuticals

This folder contains a jupyter notebook file called pymaceuticals_starter.ipynb. This notebook houses the full analysis code, which examines different drug regimens in terms of tumor volumes and total measurements taken over the study period. The analysis also looks at the potential relationship of tumor volume to weight and sex.

## Resources

This folder houses the two raw study data files used in the analysis. These include:

* Mouse_metadata.csv: Provides summary data on the mice participating in the study.
* Study_results.csv: Includes time series data for each mouse collected over the study period.
